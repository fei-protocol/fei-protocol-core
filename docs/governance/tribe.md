description: The TRIBE governance token for Fei DAO

# Tribe

The TRIBE governance token is collectively responsible for managing the [Fei DAO](fei-dao.md). 

## Design

TRIBE's total initial supply is 1 billion. The minting capability is controlled by an appointed minter address \(this is different from the Minter💰 role\). The minter is originally set to the Fei DAO Timelock.

The code for TRIBE is forked from the [Uniswap UNI token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984#code). The main difference is that UNI can only inflate 2% per year, whereas TRIBE has uncapped inflation.

## Distribution

The Fei Core team wants TRIBE to have a balanced distribution between Community, Team, and Investors while prioritizing the Community. We embedded both capital favoring and non-capital favoring distribution mechanisms, and emphasize equal opportunity through the Genesis Group.

High-level TRIBE distribution:

* 40% DAO treasury
* 20% Initial DEX Offering
* 13% Fei Core Team
* 10% Genesis Group
* 10% Staking Rewards
* 5% Investors
* 2% Grants

Medium announcement provides more details regarding the distribution.
