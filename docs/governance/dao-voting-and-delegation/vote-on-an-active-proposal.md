# Vote on an Active Proposal

Before getting started, ensure that you have connected your wallet.

{% page-ref page="connect-your-wallet.md" %}

Also confirm you have voting power delegated to your address. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="delegate-votes.md" %}

## How to Vote:

Select the active proposal that you'd like to vote on. You can access this from the [Fei Protocol Governance](https://www.withtally.com/governance/fei) page, and then scroll down below the delegate voting power chart.

Click on the "vote" button in the upper right corner of the page.

On the voting pop up, select your preferred option and click the "submit your vote" button.

Confirm and sign the transaction via Metamask.

## Confirm your vote status:

Start by navigating to your address's voter page. If you are among the top 100 addresses by voting power, you can link to your voter page through the "top voters" table at the bottom of the Fei Protocol governance page. Alternatively, you can view your address's voter page by pasting the following link into your browser with the relevant details.

On your address's voting page, scroll down to the recent vote section. Your most recent vote will be displayed at the top of the table.
