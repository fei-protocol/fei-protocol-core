Summary:
Grant optimistic approval the rate limited ability to mint FEI, to continue to fund DAO operations like FIP-13 lending deployments and potentially Liquidity-as-a-Service.
Additionally mint an initial 100M FEI to the timelock.

Also transitions remaining roles from FIP-31.

Motivation:
Instead of continually going back to the DAO to ask for more funding, Fei Protocol can deploy a contract which allows the OA timelock to mint FEI periodically.
This minter will have a hard rate limit on the amount minted. These mintings will still be subject to the 4 day timelock, but would not require governance intervention.

Unrelated to the main proposal, this proposal also transitions the Tribe minter role from the old DAO timelock to the new DAO timelock.
