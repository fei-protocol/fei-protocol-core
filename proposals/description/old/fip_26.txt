This proposal introduces a number of changes related to the FEI redemption spread and bonding curve parameters.

Tightening FEI redemption spread to 0.5%:
1. Set Bonding Curve Buffer to 0.5% (from 1%)
2. Set Reserve Stabilzier price to $0.995 (from $0.99)

Increasing Bonding Curve capacity:
1. Set DAI Mint Cap to 150M (from 50M)
2. Set DAI Scale to 100M (from 50M)
3. Set DAI Pre-Scale Discount to 0
4. Set DPI Mint Cap to 50M (from 10M)
5. Set RAI Mint Cap to 20M (from 10M)

This proposal would further tighten the FEI peg and allow for additional diverisification through increased bonding curve caps.
