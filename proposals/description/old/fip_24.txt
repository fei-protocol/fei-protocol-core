FIP-24 Gas Refund for TribalChief Transition

This proposal will provide gas refunds in the form of FEI to eligible addresses and fund the OA multisig with ETH to carry out the token multisend transactions.

Eligibliity is defined as follows:

A user must have >$1 worth of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked between August 1, 2021 and September 3, 2021.
A user must have at least the same amount of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked in TribalChief on September 30 at 11:59PM PST. 
To account for dust and other inefficiencies, users will still be eligible if they have at least 98% of the same number of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked.

Specifically, this proposal will:
    1 - Mint 1 million FEI (the upper bound of possible eligible addresses) to the optimistic mulitisig (triblechief) timelock
    2 - Withdraw 50 ETH from old ETH reserve stabilizer and send to OA multisig to pay for multisend gas fees and future operations
    3 - Withdraw remaining eth in old reserve stabilizer and send to new reserve stabilizer
