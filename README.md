# Fei Protocol Â·

Smart contract code for Fei Protocol and the FEI stablecoin

## To get started:
1. Git clone this repo: git clone git@github.com:fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core.git
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set the relevant environment variables in a gitignored `.env`: `MAINNET_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` and `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`. You can use the `.env.example` as a base
4. To run the Hardhat based unit tests, run `npm run test:hardhat`

### Setting up Forge
Fei makes use of Forge as a smart contract development framework alongside Hardhat. To set this up run: `npm run setup`

## Dependencies
 Note that this has only been tested on Linux; you may encounter issues running on other operating systems.
 
 - Node v12 or v16 (you can manage Node versions easily with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
