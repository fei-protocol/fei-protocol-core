    @title Fei Risk Curve Interface
    @author Fei Protocol

    Risk Curves define a set of balancer weights for a given level of *leverage* in the PCV, which is computable from the collateralization ratio.

    The goal is to have higher weights on stable assets at high leverage (low collateralization) to derisk, and add more volatile assets at high collateralization.

    The Risk Curve will also take into account the magnitute of the change in weights to determine an amount of time to transition
